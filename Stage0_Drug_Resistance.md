**Drug Resistance:**

Drugs are generally medicines used to treat any disease or infection caused by microbes. When a drug fails or reduces its effectiveness in treating the infection in an organism, we can define that those pathogens are resistant to the drug (Campbell & Reece, 2005). Drug resistance is a major challenge in todayâ€™s medical era. Pathogens or diseased cells develop ways to avoid the impact of drugs aimed at destroying or restraining them, resulting in formerly manageable diseases becoming harder to control. This leads to higher mortality rates, prolonged illnesses, and increased healthcare expenses (Ventola, 2015).

AMR, known as antimicrobial resistance, is the most widely recognized drug resistance, impacting bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites (World Health Organization, 2021). Overuse of antibiotics leads to a situation where the drug becomes less effective, loses its ability to kill bacteria, and even develops resistant organisms. These resistant organisms cause infections that are hard and costly to treat, resulting in serious health complications, especially in susceptible groups (Ventola, 2015). For example, in the treatment of cancer, drug resistance occurs when cancer cells develop the ability to withstand the impact of treatments like chemotherapy and targeted therapies due to mutations. This resistance often results in treatment failure, disease progression, and increased death rates (Campbell & Reece, 2005).

Microorganisms demonstrate resistance to antimicrobial agents through different mechanisms, which enable them to stay alive and multiply even in the presence of drugs designed to destroy them (World Health Organization, 2021). There are four primary ways in which this resistance develops: i) drug inactivation, where the microorganism withstands the antimicrobial activity by modifying it before it acts upon them; ii) by altering the target site, microbes become resistant by changing their target locations, which hinders antimicrobials from effectively binding and interrupting crucial processes; iii) alteration of the metabolic pathway, microorganisms develop resistance by bypassing the targeted metabolic pathways, either by no longer relying on them or by using alternative pathways; iv) reduced drug accumulation, microorganisms resist antimicrobials by reducing drug concentration inside the cell, either by limiting drug entry or actively pumping it out (Ventola, 2015).

Also, the lack of selectivity in traditional antibiotics results in the indiscriminate killing of both harmful pathogens and beneficial commensal bacteria, potentially harming the immune system and creating strong selective pressures that drive resistance (Campbell & Reece, 2005). Additionally, the similarity in structure between new antibiotics and existing drugs often limits their development, highlighting the critical need for innovative antibiotics that can target specific mechanisms without affecting the normal flora (Ventola, 2015). Targeting bacterial virulence factors presents an alternative approach to traditional antibiotics, potentially stopping pathogenesis without imposing life-or-death pressure on the bacteria (World Health Organization, 2021). Therefore, designing a drug with a resistance factor that covers the mechanisms mentioned above is highly needed to overcome the problem of drug resistance (Ventola, 2015).
